Create a tidy data set, and show associated analysis

1. Download the zip file and unzip it in your local folder
2. ensure that your working directory is set to where the files are located
3. load training and test data sets into data frames
4. the general idea is that the features data set (features.txt file) will be used to generate column names for the X_train.txt file and the X_test.txt file when they are loaded into individual data frames
5. cbind and rbind functions will allow to combine data sets
6. subset data for columns that match the pattern for mean, and std strings.
7. execution of run_analysis.R will create a text file called tidyDataSet.txt
